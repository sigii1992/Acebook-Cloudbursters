## Quickstart

First, clone this repository. Then:

```bash
> bundle install
> bin/rails db:create
> bin/rails db:migrate

> bundle exec rspec # Run the tests to ensure it works
> bin/rails server # Start the server at localhost:3000
```

## Troubleshooting

If you don't have Node.js installed yet, you might run into this error when running rspec:

```
ExecJS::RuntimeUnavailable:
  Could not find a JavaScript runtime. See https://github.com/rails/execjs for a list of available runtimes.
```

Rails requires a Javascript runtime to work. The easiest way is to install Node by running `brew install node` - and then run `bundle exec rspec` again
